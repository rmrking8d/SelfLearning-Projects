For this project, I attempted to use OOP, Python and Pygame to make a replica of Aim Lab's Tile Frenzy Minigame. Aim Lab is a software in which user can practice their aiming skills by doing a variety of minigames. 
In this minigame, players shoot a tile that constantly respawns.

ISSUES:
- collision in pygame is weird
- Wanted to add three tiles at once
- maybe a start screen and timer?
